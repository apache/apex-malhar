Hadoop is the Elephant King!
A yellow and elegant thing.
He never forgets
Useful data, or lets
An extraneous element cling!
A wonderful king is Hadoop.
The elephant plays well with Sqoop.
But what helps him to thrive
Are Impala, and Hive,
And HDFS in the group.
Hadoop is an elegant fellow.
An elephant gentle and mellow.
He never gets mad,
Or does anything bad,
Because, at his core, he is yellow.
